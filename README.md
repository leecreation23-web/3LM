### 💠 INTRODUCTION

**3LM (Three-Layer Motion)** is a cinematic prompting language invented by **Ahamed Sharaf** to control the visual, temporal, and emotional aspects of AI-generated motion.
It is a compressed **film scripting system for AI models** such as *Sora 2, Kling, Runway Gen-3,* and other cinematic video generators.

Unlike typical text prompts, 3LM is built as a **time-coded cinematic grammar**, giving the creator full control over timing, framing, lighting, tone, and symbolism — transforming prompts into *machine-readable film direction.*

---

### ⚙️ CORE STRUCTURE

3LM operates on **three foundational layers**, each defining a key dimension of motion:

#### **LAYER 1 — Temporal Flow (Motion Layer)**

Defines *timing, shot order,* and *scene pacing*.

```
-[ #1 0.05s ]   → start of first frame/scene
-[ #2 3.4s ]    → transition to second scene
```

Each bracket represents a **shot unit** or **cut**, allowing micro‑precision over runtime.

#### **LAYER 2 — Cinematic Metadata (Lens Layer)**

The technical and visual language of the shot. Each shot includes directives:

```
ACTION: describes subject behavior
CAMERA: defines coverage, lens motion, or transition (WS→CU, dolly, pan)
LIGHT: controls lighting setup (rim, bounce, volumetric, etc.)
GRADE: defines color grade and tone (e.g., blue‑steel, golden haze)
AUDIO: specifies ambient or sound design (wind rumble, static hum)
```

Example:

```
ACTION: lone wolf steps forward, frost cracking;  
CAMERA: WS→50mm dolly‑in;  
LIGHT: moonbeam rim + snow scatter;  
GRADE: cyan‑crush; halation 0.8;  
AUDIO: low wind, echo pulse;
```

#### **LAYER 3 — Symbolic Emotion (Meta Layer)**

The emotional and thematic layer expressed through symbols.

```
/* rise loop */ | void hum | {static grief}
```

* `/* */` = abstract theme/metaphor
* `| |` = ambient motif or emotional resonance
* `{}` = psychological or sensory state

Together, these create a multilayered, cinematic syntax that mirrors how directors plan emotional beats.

---

### 🧩 SYNTAX DNA

* **Single Paragraph Format:** one continuous flow — no line breaks between shots.
* **Symbols of Motion:**

  * `→` = transition or motion path
  * `;` = micro‑pause or rhythm break
  * `:` = directive assignment
* **Tagging Emotion:** blend tags like `/* rebirth */`, `{serenity}`, or `| distortion |` to color each shot.

### 🎞️ EXAMPLE — Standard 3LM Prompt

```
# LONE_WOLF_BLUE — [ #1 0.05s ] ACTION: lone wolf on frozen ridge; CAMERA: WS→50mm dolly; LIGHT: cold cyan rim; GRADE: steel blue; AUDIO: breath echo — [ #2 4.3s ] ACTION: eyes reflect aurora; CAMERA: CU rack; LIGHT: aurora flicker; GRADE: teal halation; AUDIO: heartbeat under wind | /* frozen spirit */.
```

Each segment reads like a **film reel encoded in text** — every second, lens, and tone precisely defined.

---

### 🧠 CREATIVE INTENT

3LM exists to bridge human cinematic thinking and AI visual logic.
Its goal: **make AI understand film direction through syntax** — where timing, emotion, and light become programmable.
